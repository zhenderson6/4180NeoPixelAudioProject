# 4180NeoPixelAudioProject
#### Zachary Henderson
This is my Github for my final 4180 project for Spring 2021. The goal is to be able to have a 8x8 Neopixel LED array function as an audio visualizer as well as other fun designs.
For the audio visualizer demo, I have this youtube video of about 30 seconds of the pixels functioning.
When implementing the code, I chose to draw lines across the neo pixel, in alternating diagnoals from each recognized sound, so that the changes in audio picked up can be clearly seen
The other designs are an intilization, so that the code can be seen functioning properly before moving into the audio recognition.
I have attached the link to the playlist for my two videos, incase the links uploaded to the microsoft form didn't work
